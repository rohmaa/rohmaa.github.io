               <h1>welcome</h1> <h2>to my WEBSITE.</h2>
<P> 
This is the place where I will write about myself. So, where do I start? My name is Rohma Mirza, I'm 16 years old, I go to New Utrecth High School and I live in Staten Island, New York. My favorite sport to play is soccer and my favorite sport to watch is hockey. I LOVE music. I love all kind of music but my favorite are; rap and hip hop. When i grow up i hope to be a doctor, hopefully a neurosurgeon. I'm interested in that because I just love how our brain works and how it does do many incredible things in milliseconds. I'm interested in learning more about the brain and to help people that have life threathing illnesses or injuries. To me the brain is VERY much like a computer but its organic. The brain, like a computer, does complex processings in the matter of seconds and is the BIGGEST reason for us being alive and moving. Our bodies can live without many organs and for other organs our bodies can live with a replacement, but our brain is one organ that we cannot live without and that cannot be replaced. In my future I would love to stay in New York for my college and job and hopefully even go to NYU.

       <h2> Today: Thursday, July 19th </h2>
       <p> So, Today I was very tired when I woke up and was not feeling like going to NYU or work. But I got up and i had to rush cause I was not getting a ride, I had to take the bus and so i had to do everything in a hurry. But when i got into class we did an activity and it was a mystery thing. And that woke me up a bit but also gave me a headache.
